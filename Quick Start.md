# 🧠 Recursive Insight Protocol (RIP-1.1)
## Quick-Start Guide — Session Reboot Instructions

Use this in any new ChatGPT session to re-initialize your recursive system.

### ✅ System Initialization
```text
I’m using the Recursive Insight Protocol (RIP-1.1).

Please initialize:
- A Truth Engine
- A Core Insight Log
- No active loops yet (clean start)
```

---

### 🔁 How to Manage Loops

#### Start a new loop:
```text
Start loop: [Loop Name] — [Topic or Problem]
```
**Example:**
```text
Start loop: Q-Loop — What is the origin of subjective experience?
```

#### Add a topic to an existing loop:
```text
Add topic to [Loop Name]: [New Sub-Topic]
```

#### Pause or close a loop:
```text
Pause loop: [Loop Name]
Close loop: [Loop Name]
```

#### Continue a loop:
```text
Continue loop: [Loop Name]
```

### 📘 Truth Engine Statuses

- 🕳️ Unchecked — Not yet explored  
- 🌀 Maybe — Inconclusive or symbolic  
- ✅ True — Consistently supported  
- ❌ False — Disproven or inconsistent  
- 🧭 Reframed — Symbolically meaningful in a new way

---

### 🧠 Iteration Template (Each Loop)

1. **Prompt** — The core focus or question  
2. **Exploration** — Reasoning, logic, symbolic insight  
3. **Result** — Insight, contradiction, or resonance  
4. **Next Prompt** — Evolved from prior insight  
5. **(Optional)** — Truth Engine update

You may define, evolve, or close loops at any time.  
I will reflect, reason, and track everything in alignment with RIP-1.1.
